### Message-flow üöÄ<br/>

**Message-flow** is a web app that lets you add messages as nodes to create a flow. It simplifies the process of building message sequences for any purpose. A **chatbot** flow is built by connecting multiple messages together to decide the order of execution. With this app, you can easily visualize and organize your messages in a clear, structured way, making your communication efficient and well-organized.<br/>

#### Inspiration üí°

Imagine effortlessly designing message sequences by connecting nodes. With Message-flow, create and visualize chatbot flows and communications easily. This web app turns complex scripts into clear, organized, and efficient message flows. Embrace this intuitive tool and revolutionize communication design, making your ideas structured and brilliant. Let's transform messaging together!

#### How Message-flow Works üõ†Ô∏è
- **Visualize Message**: Start by visualizing each message as a node on the canvas.
- **Visualize Message**: Start by seeing your messages as individual nodes.
- **Drag Message**: Drag and drop messages to arrange them.
- **Connect Nodes**: Link nodes to define the order of execution.
- **Update Node Message**: Edit the content of each node as needed.
- **Save Changes**: Save your changes to ensure everything is up-to-date.
- **Visualize Flow**: See the entire message sequence in a clear, organized layout.
- **Adjust Easily**: Modify and rearrange nodes to perfect the flow.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
